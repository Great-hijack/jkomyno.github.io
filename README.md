# jkomyno.github.io [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jkomyno/jkomyno.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jkomyno/jkomyno.github.io)

Personal homepage built with ReactJS, Bulma and SCSS, and deployed on [link](https://jkomyno.github.io).
I have used React.Portal for displaying the navbar and React.Context to share some common information about me troughout multiple pages.
Every section has its React component and the layout structure, as well as the UI elements, are entirely
composable and reusable.
